# Modelling in ANN

Deep Learning is the most exciting and powerful branch of Machine Learning. It's a technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind many of the technologies we are using today.

Goal is to provide an efficient system that can recoginize the correct type of cloth from a set of data containing numerous values.

## ðŸ”¨ Basic Working 

We took one of the most famous datasets, i.e., Fashion Mnist and on this dataset we splitted the data into train and test data.
After making the proper installations data is plotted so that the structure can be analysed which is then led by normalizing the data.

Flattening of dataset is done in order to convert 3D matrix in 2D.
